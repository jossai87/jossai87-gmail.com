Challenge 2 - eBook Application

This application was built to return the 10 most frequently used words from eBooks on gutenberg.org.
It prompts the user twice for input. For the first user input, an integer is required for how 
many books they would like to reference. The second user input requires the user to enter in a URL for 
an eBook from the gutenberg.org website. Once these entries are made, a dictionary will be displayed showing
the top ten most frequently used words from the eBooks entered.
